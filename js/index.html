<h2>AngryBirdsPrototype</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
After seeing some phaser tutorials I figured I would try making angry birds from what I know in phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to see how well I can recreate a popular video game series using my new knowledge of phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Since this is a crecreation of Angry Birds it is under the genre of action, adventure.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players must aim and shoot birds at nearby pigs.  If they kill all the pigs they win.  If they run out of birds they lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this protoype is to recreate a popular gaming franchise to the best of my ability.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
As with the original Angry Birds this game has all the addicting fun features you have come to love.  This game involves your favorite red bird and pigs as well as the ability to launch them.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place in the normal angry birds world.  Where that takes place is unknown.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As with every angry birds the pigs have stolen the flocks eggs.  It is up to the birds to launch themselves at the nasty pigs and get their eggs back.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Angry Birds targets people of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This version of Angry Birds only takes a few seconds as their is only one bird to attack.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The strategy is to aim your bird correctly at the pigs and shoot them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All images were found using google.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Since this game takes inspiration from Angry Birds its pretty easy to tell what the closest other game is.
